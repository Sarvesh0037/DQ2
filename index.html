      <h1>I'm Sorry ðŸ’«ðŸ’”</h1>
      <p>
        I never wanted to make things uncomfortable.<br />
        I just wanted to be honest about how I feel.<br /><br />

        I respect your feelings and your space â€” always.<br />
        I didnâ€™t create this to change your mind, only to say this, from the heart:<br /><br />

        <strong>Thank you</strong> for being a part of my life for these 6 years.<br />
        You brought light to my world, and Iâ€™ll always cherish that.<br /><br />

        Iâ€™m truly sorry if I ever made you feel awkward or pressured.<br />
        That was never my intention. I care about you deeply, and I genuinely wish you happiness â€” always.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know you're not interested in me that way.<br />
        I knew you'd say no, and that's why I never said anything sooner.<br />
        But please donâ€™t ever think I was trying to cheat you or break our friendship.<br /><br />

        The truth is... I suffered quietly, because our friendship meant everything to me.<br />
        You're the only girl who's ever meant this much to me.<br />
        Even now, I canâ€™t explain exactly why â€” I just feel it deeply.<br /><br />

        I even spoke to my mom about it â€” and surprisingly, she said the same thing you did.<br />
        But she also told me something important...<br /><br />

        "You didnâ€™t do anything wrong by feeling what you feel â€” just be honest and respectful."<br /><br />

        Please don't treat me like a stranger now.<br />
        I took every risk silently, hid every emotion â€” only to protect what we had.<br />
        I never wanted to lose our bond. I just wanted to be real â€” with love, not pressure.<br /><br />

        Even my mom knows how much you mean to me...<br />
        I just hope, someday, youâ€™ll understand this wasnâ€™t about expecting anything â€”<br />
        It was about being honest, before silence turned into regret.
